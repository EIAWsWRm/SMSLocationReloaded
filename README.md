### This app is privacy-oriented:

No network permission is requested, so you don't have to worry about your data being sent in the background.
Requests minimal amount of permissions.

### Permissions explained:

Location: Required to get your location to send.<br />
SMS: Required to get your location to send.<br />
Phone: Some phones have a poorly implemented SMS sending API, and they require you to grant the READ_PHONE_STATE permission to send text messages. We will NEVER call any numbers, read call logs, or change your phone settings.<br />
Foreground Service: Required to send message in the background (only implemented if you choose to send message from home 
screen). We do not run other tasks in the background besides this one.
